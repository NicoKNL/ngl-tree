## Running the app
### Production
- Check if the `dist/` folder exists
- In case this folder exists, open the `index.html` file in a browser, and you should be good to go!
- If this directory does not (yet) exists, continue.
- Make sure you have NodeJS ([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), choose LTS) and the package manager Yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)) installed and added to your path (meaning it should be accessible via the command line).
- Run `yarn` from the project directory
- Run `yarn build`
- Repeat step 1
### Development
- Make sure you have NodeJS ([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), choose LTS) and the package manager Yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)) installed and added to your path (meaning it should be accessible via the command line).
- Run `yarn` from the project directory
- Run `yarn start`
- You're all setup! Live-reload should automatically update your code while you're working on it.
